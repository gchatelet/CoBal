CoBal stands for Collaborative Balance
======================================

It's a web application now based on Play! framework to manage who gave
and who took from a community. It's intended to be accessible from
cell phones as well as computers. It helps you know who owes what to who.

It's under early development for the moment though.

Getting started
---------------

Download play framework : http://www.playframework.org and unzip.

Go to the directory containing this file and launch tests by typing
> play test

Now open a browser to http://localhost:9000/@tests , select all
unit tests and push the start button. Everything should be green : )
